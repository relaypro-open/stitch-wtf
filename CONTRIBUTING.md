# Contributing to Stacks

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Stacks, the Terraform code pre-processor!
Your contributions help us improve and enhance the project for everyone.

## How to Contribute

All kinds of contributions are welcome!
Whether you're interested in coding, documentation, bug reports, or feature requests, your input is valuable.

Please be respectful, inclusive, and considerate towards other contributors. Harassment or offensive behavior is not tolerated.

## Getting Started

To contribute to Stacks, follow these general steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in your forked repository.
3. Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes.
4. Our team will review your PR and provide feedback. Please be patient during the review process.

To test the repository while you're developing, install the package as "editable" with `pip`.
Run this command from the root of the repository after cloning:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

If you get an error like below, try upgrading `pip`:

```shell
ERROR: File "setup.py" or "setup.cfg" not found. Directory cannot be installed in editable mode: /Users/sweaver/Git/stacks
(A "pyproject.toml" file was found, but editable mode currently requires a setuptools-based build.)

$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Coding Guidelines

We don't have strict coding style rules, but please aim to keep your code consistent with the existing style in the repository.

## Licensing
